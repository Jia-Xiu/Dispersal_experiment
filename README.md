# Dispersal_experiment
The dispersal microcosom experiment was performed in March-August 2018. 
The following is the scripts related to this manuscript: *Dispersal by inundation significantly alters soil bacterial communities in early but not late successional stages*, authored by Xiu Jia, Cas Cornet and Joana Falc√£o Salles

## Analysis 16S rRNA sequences (DNA- and RNA-based) 
Work at [QIIME2/2019.10](https://docs.qiime2.org/2019.10/) environment, using the following script
